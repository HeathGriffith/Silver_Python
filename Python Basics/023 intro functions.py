# 'greet' is the function name, same rules for naming as variables; round brackets empty in this case
def greet():
    # single indented instruction that will be executed every time function is invoked (call)
    print('Hello my dear!')

# call it
greet()
# call it as many times as like
greet()
greet()

# keep all function defs at top of file, as good practice
